Your grade point average (GPA) is calculated by dividing the total amount of grade points earned by the total amount of credit hours attempted. Your grade point average may range from 0.0 to a 4.0.
For example:

- A = 4.00 grade points
- A- = 3.70 grade points
- B+ = 3.33 grade points
- B = 3.00 grade points
- B- = 2.70 grade points
- C+ = 2.30 grade points
- C = 2.00 grade points
- C- = 1.70 grade points
- D+ = 1.30 grade points
- D = 1.00 grade points
- D- = 0.70 grade points
- WF/F=0 grade points
